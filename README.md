The Myth Of Production
Project Description: 
This website explores the myths surrounding productivity in the digital age, particularly its influence on social media and daily life. It delves into the pervasive mindset of always striving to be productive—thoughts like "Today, I’m going to be extremely productive, isolate myself, and dedicate all my time to work." This mentality is especially common among university students, who often feel immense academic pressure and a constant need to achieve milestones within certain timelines.
Through this website, I aim to create a narrative that reflects the internal dialogues of these productivity-driven individuals. The experience illustrates the exhaustion that comes from the relentless pursuit of productivity, the burden of long-term planning, and the emotional disconnect that can arise from over-prioritizing efficiency over genuine human connection. In the end, the website emphasizes the importance of balance—showing that it’s okay to let go of rigid productivity structures, the importance of spending time with your loved ones, and embrace the spontaneity of life.
The attached video begins with a portrayal of shared intrusive thoughts about productivity and negative thoughts about one’s self, particularly among university students. It then contrasts this with moments of joy—highlighting how spending time with a loved one can shift one's perspective. The transition from late-night worries to a lighthearted, present-focused reality reinforces the idea that true fulfillment comes not just from accomplishments but from meaningful experiences and relationships.

Process:
I began by reflecting on the struggles many people face with productivity—challenges that are often misunderstood or shaped by misconceptions. My own experiences with this mindset made me realize its impact only in hindsight, which inspired me to explore it further in this project.
The development process started with structuring the website using HTML, determining the core elements it should include. From there, I moved on to designing the layout with CSS, beginning with background selection. After multiple trials and errors, I sourced suitable backgrounds from Freepik that complemented the certain themes I was looking for.
Building the website involved a lot of experimentation, as I had numerous ideas in mind. To maintain consistency and flexibility, I created reusable CSS classes to apply common styles across different elements, ensuring a cohesive design while seamlessly integrating them with the javascript for interactivity and/or animation for the elements added.
1. Planning the Structure
Before writing any code,figuring out the structure of the website was an essential step:
Defining the purpose: The site tells a story about productivity and self-reflection, so each section should build on that.
The flow of the website– A linear scroll with distinct sections works best.
Elements to make the website engaging– Things like animated text, layered visuals, and smooth transitions.
2. Designing the Look & Feel
The design needs to complement the theme
Typography – Using a clean, modern font ('Inconsolata') to keep it readable but slightly techy.
Color & Contrast – Bright and light backgrounds to separate sections and add depth.
Layout & Effects:
A hero section with a background image that sets the tone.
Text animations that slide in dynamically.
Speech bubbles to emphasize key ideas.
Layered images/videos to create visual interest.
3. Developing the Site
This is where the actual coding happens.
A. Structuring with HTML
The index.html file organizes everything:
Sections – Each thought/idea gets its own <div class="section"> so it’s easy to control.
Text & Media – <h2> for main thoughts, <p> for details, and <img>/<video> for visuals.
Buttons & Links – Used for navigation and engagement (like “Find out more”).
B. Styling with CSS
The style.css file is where the design and visuals of the website are implemented:
Smooth scrolling (scroll-behavior: smooth;) so transitions feel natural.
Background images for each section (background: url('line1.png')).
Typography choices (font-family: 'Inconsolata', monospace;).
Key animations:
Slide-in text (@keyframes slideIn) for an interactive feel.
Sun-ray pulse effect (@keyframes sunPulse) for subtle motion.
Responsiveness tweaks – Making sure elements adjust properly on different screen sizes.
C. Adding Interactivity with JavaScript
Scrolling effects – Making sections appear smoothly as you scroll.
Hover/click interactions – Maybe buttons that trigger animations or change styles.
4. Testing & Debugging
Once the site was built, I tested the website for:
Responsiveness – Making sure it looks good on different devices.
Performance – Optimizing images/animations so they don’t lag.
Functionality – Checking that buttons, links, and interactions work properly.
5. Deploying the Website
Once the website is fully functional, I’d deploy it using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. That means:
Uploading all files (index.html, style.css, script.js, images/videos).
Connecting a domain (if needed).
Running a final check to make sure everything works live.

Reflection/Evaluation:
At the start, the idea was to explore "The Myth of Productivity" through a website inspired by Fantastic Mr. Fox. I intended to mirror the film’s warm, autumnal color palette, using its rich oranges, browns, and yellows to create a nostalgic yet refined aesthetic. However, during the design process, I stumbled upon a Y2K-inspired layout on Freepik that immediately caught my attention. Its bold typography, neon gradients, and chaotic energy felt unexpectedly fitting, and I found myself rethinking my entire approach.
This shift led to a more colorful, experimental design, where saturated hues and playful elements took center stage. While the aesthetic ended up being completely different from what I originally planned, the core idea remained intact—presenting my perspective in a visually compelling way. More importantly, the final version successfully integrated interactive components, making the experience feel immersive rather than static. In the end, while my vision evolved significantly, the project still captured my intended message, just in a more dynamic and unconventional way than I first imagined.
