    <section id="1">
        <p>Do you ever feel like you are not quite there yet?</p>
        <p>Will I finally reach this stage of euphoria and satisfaction if I do x,y, and then all the time in the world?</p>
        <p>I just need to find the correct productivity system, and stop procrastination, and then I will get there...</p>
    </section>

    <section id="2">
        <p>Every time I finish something, there is the feeling of "Oh, I can do one more thing."</p>
        <p>By getting things done, am I creating more things to be done with?</p>
        <p>All doing as a result of the fear for the future, instrumentalizing time, systemizing my existence, for the feeling of control over the uncertainty of life.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="3">
        <p>Perhaps, there is nothing wrong with having some uncertainty.</p>
        <p>While having some certainty is good, planning my entire daily routine around productivity might not be the best approach.</p>
        <p>I no longer should manifest in the bottomless bucket list; go to all the places my friends have been to, getting 5 internships before I graduate, etc.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="4">
        <p>Even the best life we could imagine will be one of waving goodbyes to endless possibilities of what you could have done, and that is okay as long as the process is cherished.</p>
        <p>The day of no more problems will never end, and actually come to appreciate the process and limited control you have.</p>
    </section>



    <section id="5">
        <p>All you can do is live in the present.</p>
        <p>Even if you plan for a far ahead future, you will never feel prepared.</p>
