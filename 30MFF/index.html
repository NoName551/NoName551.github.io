      <h1>The Myth Of Productivity</h1>

      <div class="w3-sand w3-grayscale w3-large" style="background-color: #f5f5dc;">


          <section id="scene1">
              <p>Do you ever feel like you are not quite there yet?</p>
              <p>Will I finally reach this stage of euphoria and satisfaction if I do x,y, and then all the time in the world?</p>
              <p>I just need to find the correct productivity system, and stop procastination, and then I will get there...</p>
          </section>

          <section id="scene2">
              <p>Every time I finish something, there is the feelingo of "Oh, I can do one more thing."</p>
              <p>By getting things done, am I creating more things to be done with?</p>
              <p>All doing as a result of the fear for the future, instrumentalizing time, systemizing my existence, for the feeling of control over the uncertainity of life.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="scene3">
              <p>Perhaps, there is nothing wrong with having some uncertainity.</p>
              <p>While having some certainty is good, planning my entire daily routine around productivity might not be the best approach.</p>
              <p>
                  I do not want my days to be mereley a pathological quest to do more and more, as an act of escape, by putting off on having to be in the present,
                  without ever asking myself whether I am in the right track or not.
              </p>
              <p>I no longer should manifest in the bottomless bucket list; go to all the places my friends have been to, getting 5 internships before I graduate, etc. </p>

          <section id="scene4">
              <p>
                  Even the best life we could imagine will be one of waving goodbyes to endless possibilities of what you could have done, and that is okay as long as
                  long as the process is cherished
              </p>
              <p>Life itself will end, and time spent with others will feel more real and meaningful the more time shared with each other</p>
              <p>
                  By accepting my limiations, meaningful decisions that go beyond getting everything done will begin to cultivate patience. We start to accept that life
                  devoid of problems is not much of a life at all.
              </p>
              <p>The day of no more problems will never end, and actually come to appreciate the process and limited control you have.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="scene5">
              <p>All you can do is live in the present. </p>
              <p>Even if you plan for a far ahead future, you will never feel prepared.</p>
              <p>
                  Stop waiting for the right moment and look at what you have done. Your life is now, and what can you do to make the most out of the time left? Not for
                  for the society, but for yourself, your life.
